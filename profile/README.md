Interoperatable PHP Object Interfaces
=====================================

## About us
We define interfaces for interoperating with php objects. We propose interfaces for PHP objects pointing to the next era.

We should aim to replace ourselves with others.
What remains when your programs are gone are the definitions of the interfaces.
Your programs may become obsolete, and someone else's programs may become obsolete.
We need definitions of interfaces that don't depend on anyone in particular.
However, the interface of PHP-Fig is too unsatisfactory.
We define interfaces that are used in practice.

Do you want to join the new standard?

## Standards of rigor
The definition has several standards of rigor.
We plan to add more interfaces in the future if you want to be more rigidly defined.
At each stage the namespace changes so that new and old definitions can coexist.

- lenient: Interface definitions that can be used in legacy systems. Available for PHP5.3 or higher.
- polite: Interface definitions that can be used in systems that want to be defined a little more rigidly. Available for PHP7.2 or higher.
